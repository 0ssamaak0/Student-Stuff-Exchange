SSE: Student Stuff Exchange, a website which allow exchanging items
between students at any place e.g. university, high school, academy and etc.

The main idea that every student does not have to buy everything! many other student
especially older ones can help! and for older students, you may does not have to
keep your first level algebra book in your tile of books!

how this gonna work? it's all simple, just register and go to the home pages:

- if you have something for your mates, just post it and tag it with the suitable tag.
- if you need something, you can search in the tags for it, but keep in mind you can't take a taken item i.e. in the Unavailable tag
- assuming your posted item has been taken, you can move to your chats and message the person
  which you will take / give the item to. and determine where you can meet
